== Installing python dependencies

This project uses a Pipfile to lock all the dependencies, to setup you will need to install pipenv.
`pip install pipenv`. 
You will also need `pg_config`, you can fetch it by installing `postgresql-devel` on fedora or `libpq-dev` in debian based distros.

Once dev tools are installed, install this project's dependencies with: `pipenv install`.

`pipenv` installs by default all dependencies in a virtual environment, for simplicity you can configure your environment
to run inside it by running: `pipenv shell` or prepend any of the following commands with: `pipenv run`

== Configuring your environment

Before starting this service, you need to set the following env variables.

- DATABASE_URL - e.g.  postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/notifications-db
- KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS
- KAFKA_QUEUE_HOOK
- KAFKA_QUEUE_EMAIL
- BOP_URL
- BOP_APITOKEN
- BOP_CLIENT_ID
- BOP_ENV

== Installing database schema

Make sure the database already exists and has the `pgcrypto` extension created e.g.:

```
 \c notifications-db;
 CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
```

Run ``alembic upgrade head`` from the `app` folder to create/update your database schema.

== Running the application

From the main directory, run:

``uvicorn app.main:notif_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080``

== Tests

Tests that affect multiple modules ("integration testing") should be placed in the ``tests`` directory. This includes any
tests that require database or other external services (such as mock http server). Simple unit tests should stay inside the module.

Run tests with `pytest`
